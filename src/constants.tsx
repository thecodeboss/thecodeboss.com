        <p>
          As a founding software engineer at Kojo (later promoted to Staff
          Engineer), I built the initial version of the platform and have been
          instrumental in growing the team and product. I helped the company
          grow from a small team of 6 to over 100 employees, working on
          everything from core platform, APIs, infrastructure, CI/CD tooling,
          and developer tooling, to AI models, frontend, and more. In addition
          to direct engineering work, I&apos;ve also interviewed hundreds of
          candidates and mentored dozens of engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
          But don&apos;t just take it from me; here&apos;s a quote from one of
          my peers:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Michael is quickly able to find good solutions to problems, and often
          in areas he&apos;s not familiar with. I&apos;ve never worked with
          someone as adept as Michael about diving in somewhere new, and quickly
          providing insight in ways that others miss/overlook. He&apos;s a truly
          valuable asset in filling in gaps in our general triaging/incident
          response procedures, and I trust that the work he produces will be
          done thoughtfully and effectively.
