        I&apos;m Michael Oliver, a software engineer passionate about science,
        computing, and making a difference in the world.

        I&apos;ve been at Kojo for 5+ years where I&apos;ve been making
        construction materials management faster, easier, and more sustainable
        by empowering our engineering teams. I focus primarily on our
        infrastucture, CI/CD pipelines, and developer experience, though
        I&apos;ve been known to jump into frontend work, training AI models,
        security, or whatever else needs to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m either traveling the world, hiking,
        skiing, or gaming. I&apos;m a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy,
        so count me in for tabletop RPGs, board games, or a good book.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in eastern Canada, but moved to San Francisco, California in
        2017 where I&apos;m now a permanent resident. I&apos;ve been lucky
        enough to travel to 31 countries and counting, which includes a 4 month
        backpacking trip across Japan and a stop in every continent. I have lots
        of stories to tell, but even more to listen to!
